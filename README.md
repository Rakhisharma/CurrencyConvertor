Currency converter using Axios ajax call and fixerAPI

##### Project is available online here:  https://rakhisharma.github.io/CurrencyConvertor/

### Note: You can see the live example but it won't work. As Fixer.io provide `http` for unpaid version of there api. And github pages doesn't allow `http`. I have taken the unpaid version for this project.
